abstract="There has been considerable recent interest in algorithms for finding communities in networks--groups of vertices within which connections are dense, but between which connections are sparser. Here we review the progress that has been made towards this end. We begin by describing some traditional methods of community detection, such as spectral bisection, the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and hierarchical clustering based on similarity measures. None of these methods, however, is ideal for the types of real-world network data with which current research is concerned, such as Internet and web data and biological and social networks. We describe a number of more recent algorithms that appear to work well with these data, including algorithms based on edge betweenness scores, on counts of short loops in networks and on voltage differences in resistor networks.",

 abstract = {The paper presents an exposition of two data reduction methods widely used in the behavioral sciences and commonly referred to as the single-link and complete-link hierarchical clustering procedures. Major emphasis is placed on several statistical techniques for evaluating the adequacy of a completed partition hierarchy and, in particular, the individual partitions within the sequence. A numerical reanalysis of some previously published data is included as an illustration of the suggested methodology.},
